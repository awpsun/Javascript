So today I learnt if and else statements. the santax goes like if (condition) {code if the given condition fullfilss}
else {if the above condition is not fullfilled}
The santax is simillar to other programming languages that i've studied in the past like C, and Python.
I also learnt how to make a descision tree and made a grading marksheet
