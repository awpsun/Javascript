learnt about functions and ways to define or write a function.
a function can be used as
function functionname(variable){
    code or what will the function do
    return 
}
console.log(functionname("VARIABLE"));
another way to write a function is 

const function name = function(variable){code}; //This is called anonomoyous function

arrow function is same as anonomoyous function just remove function first and add => at the end.
You can make your own function that you will need to recall and use in your codebase.
