So i learnt today about ternary operator this is also like switch and if or else. It's basically a mini if and else
so you first give it a condition like >< or a statment or === then you give a question mark as if it's asking if that statement is true or false. 
it true first "string" will be printed and if false after : 2nd statment will be printed. 
You can nest multiple ternary into one single line as i've done in the code.
 #Homework make a rock paper scissor game with the ternary and input(lecture10). IT's 4am in the morning and I'll play cs2 after this.
